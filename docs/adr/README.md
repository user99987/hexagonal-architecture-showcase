# Architecture Decision Records

This directory captures the significant architectural decisions made in this showcase, using the
lightweight [ADR](https://adr.github.io/) format (Context / Decision / Consequences). ADRs are
immutable once accepted — if a decision is later reversed, a new ADR supersedes the old one rather
than editing it in place.
