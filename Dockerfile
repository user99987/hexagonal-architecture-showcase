# resources); stage 2 copies only the resulting jar into a slim JRE runtime image.

# Note: the builder stage intentionally isn't Alpine-based. The frontend build (Angular, via the
# Gradle node plugin) downloads official Node.js binaries, which are linked against glibc and
# don't run on Alpine's musl libc.
# Copy the Gradle wrapper and build scripts first so dependency/tooling downloads are cached
# independently of source code changes.
